This mini project is basically a Todo web-based application, so this project is divided into two main components. Our backend todo-api which handles the database modifications. It was implemented using Node.js and Express.js
- First of all you need to install the dependecies by running npm install in the directory of todo-api
Regarding the front-end it was implements using React.js and Redux using Flux architecture
- You need to install the dependcies by running npm install in the main directory of the project
After that, you need to start both of the backend and the front-end servers using different port numbers, so that our backend component could communicate with React.
